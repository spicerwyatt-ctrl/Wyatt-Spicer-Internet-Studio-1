  <h1>Wyatt's Dream Jobs</h1>
  <h2>After taking this course, I have grown to love making websites, it's just so much fun all you can do with such a simple website. From adding "tacky" animations to my South Padre Midterm project to using this html/css coding knowledge to make websites for other classes. It's so easy to make. I have a lot of friends with professional jobs making apps and websites (im 27 so all my friends are way past internships) and not a single one of them knows how to code in html or css even though it comes in handy. One friend works using Sqaurespace for their company and there are so many limitations to how you can organize and style webpages. I would like to use my knowledge I learned this semester to being better at the jobs that my friends already have.</h2>
