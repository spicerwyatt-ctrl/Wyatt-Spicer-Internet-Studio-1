<h1>Guests of Honor</h1>
<h2>A Feast Fit For Legends</h2>
<h1>Taylor Swift</h1>
	<img src="images/24taylor-notebook3-superJumbo.jpg" alt="Taylor Swift" class="celebrity-img">
	<p>I’d love to have Taylor Swift over for dinner because she’s not only an extraordinary songwriter 
		but also a cultural force who has influenced a generation through her music, storytelling, and business savvy. 
		Her ability to reinvent herself while staying authentic is something I deeply admire, and I’d be fascinated to 
		hear her perspective on creativity, fame, and resilience. I imagine she’d bring warmth and humor to the table, 
		and we could talk about everything from the craft of lyric writing to her experiences navigating the entertainment 
		industry at such a high level.</p>
<h1>Kevin Smith</h1>
	<img src="images/OIP.jfif" alt="Kevin Smith" class="celebrity-img">
	<p>Kevin Smith would be a dream dinner guest because of his quick wit, storytelling chops, and genuine love for geek culture. 
		His films like Clerks and Chasing Amy not only helped shape indie cinema but also revealed his gift for mixing humor with 
		heartfelt honesty. I’d want to hear him riff on the crazy behind-the-scenes stories of his career, his podcasting adventures, 
		and his passion for comic books and fandom. Plus, his laid-back personality makes him the kind of guest who would instantly 
		make dinner feel like a hangout among old friends.</p>
<h1>Jeff Bridges</h1>
	<img src="images/actor-jeff-bridges-in-denim-jacket-czl1k5rmmvzhpsro.jpg" alt="Jeff Bridges" class="celebrity-img">
	<p>Jeff Bridges strikes me as the kind of guest who would bring a calm, soulful presence to dinner. Known for roles ranging 
		from The Dude in The Big Lebowski to his powerful dramatic performances, he’s an actor with incredible range and a rare authenticity. 
		I’d love to hear him talk about his creative process, his music, and his outlook on life, which seems both grounded and philosophical. 
		I imagine sharing a meal with him would feel like being in the company of a wise friend who exudes positivity and has endless 
		stories to tell.</p>
