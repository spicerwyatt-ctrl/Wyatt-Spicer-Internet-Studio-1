    <h1>Blink 182</h1>
        <p1>Blink 182 is a rock band from California, founded in 1992 by Tom Delonge, Mark Hoppus, and Scott Raynor. 
          Scott Raynor was eventually replaced by Travis Barker. Blink 182 has released numerous studio albums and have 
          had numerous world tours. Though its sound has diversified throughout their career, its musical style, described as pop-punk, 
          blends catchy pop melodies with fast-paced punk rock. Its lyrics primarily focus on relationships, adolescent frustration, 
          and maturity, or lack thereof. The group emerged from a suburban, Southern California skate punk scene and first gained notoriety for 
          high-energy live shows and irreverent humor" (From Wiki).
