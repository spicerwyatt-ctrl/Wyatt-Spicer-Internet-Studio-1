    <h5>Answers to the Reading</h5>
        <p5>1. Denise Jacobs argues that we all have a troll-like inner critic. 
            Of the methods she identifies to banish this troll, 
            which would be most successful for you? Why? 
            Answer: The link to the website is broken and I couldn't find a free
            version of the book. I find the best method to banish this troll 
            is to be able to apreciate and look back on any creations. After
            enough time has passed, a creator can more objectively critique 
            their work.</p5>

            wait for the last minute to do this assignment. The awareness of the difference
            between present me and future me is very helpful in visualizing procrastinationas
            as a war within.</p6>
