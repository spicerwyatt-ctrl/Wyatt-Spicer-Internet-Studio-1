        <h1>Three Possible Domains</h1>
            <p>1. KeyBoard-Board.com, wyattspicer.com, wyatt-spicer.com</p>
        <h1>Discussion</h1>
            <p>After discussing, I decided that keyboard-board.com would be the best name for a website to advertise the product for my semester project, while wyattspicer.com will have more long term benefits. In the end I should probably buy both. </p>
