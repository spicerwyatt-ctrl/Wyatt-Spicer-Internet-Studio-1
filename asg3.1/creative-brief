    <h1>Question 1</h1>
        <p1>1. <a href="https://https://www.cottonwoodmarket.com/gallery/">Most Buttons Don't Work</a></p1>
    <h1>Question 2</h1>
        <p1>2.  Carefully planning out a story when it comes to website can be incredibly helpful. Instead of 
                just showing everything on one page, you could use links and other pages to lead users on 
                different paths to explore what your website has to offer. The other single page option might be
                Overwhelming for a user to look at. Through layers and layers of pages you can make your website
                much more interesting and usable.</p1>
    <h1>Question 3</h1>
        <p1>3.  Heirarchy in typography is important to distinguish more important information for the more
                specific information or possibly less relevant information. Through many different options
                including text size, serifs or san-serif, color, font, italics, boldness, and many more can
                affect how a website can be percieved. Heirarchy also allows the user to properly read information
                in the order that the web designer best sees fit.</p1>
