  	<h2>Questions from The Reading:</h2>
	<p>Question 1: I prefer doing low-res hand drawn wireframes initially becuase it gets my idea out quickly and allows for easy fixes by scratching stuff out in an instants. Some disadvantages of hand drawing wireframes means you may be doing dowble the work when you inevitably have to re-make the low-res as mid-res and high-res examples. Any one can low res wireframe sketch, but not everyone has the knowledge to use certain programs.</p>
	<p>Question 2: I genuinely really oorefer a nice sketched wireframe, especially if it's interactive with paper cutouts. I really enjoy printing out a sheet of paper with like 4 blank web pages or sample iphones to do my sketches. Second to that I enjoy softwares like Figma and Adobe XD. Even Canva could be used, or sheets.</p>
